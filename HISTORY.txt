V2.0.0  (Based on initial baseline)      			      08/12/2022
================================================================================
- Compatible with v2.0.0 csdllib
- autoval/validate/waterlevel.py:
  * Added functionality to parallelize the station processing by passing a
  NumberOfProcessors parameter into the *.ini file for the number of processors
  required for parallelism
- Changed the autoval/tests/oper.estofs-glo.v6.0.cwl.ini to include the
  NumberOfProcessors variable required the new version of ini file is
  autoval/tests/oper.estofs-glo.v6.1.cwl.ini


V3.0.0  (Based on V2.0.0)      			                      03/20/2024
================================================================================
- Changed the autoval/validate/waterlevel.py to include:
    - Use searvey package instead of csdllib package to download CO-OPS 
      observational data.
    - Added functionality to download, process, and compare the IOC water level 
      values with the model output.
    - Added functionality to run the code for both Pacific and Atlantic domains
      by passing the "pacific" variable into the *.ini file.
    - Added functionality to save the country of a station for the new report
      file.
    - Added functionality to use different datums for CO-OPS observationl data 
      by passing the "VDatum" variable into the *.ini file.
    - Added functionality to plot the nowcast period in addition to the forecast
      period.
    - Added functionality to show the corrected bias on time series.
- Changed the autoval/tests/*.ini to include the "Pacific", "VDatum", "Nowcast",
  "NowcastPeriod", "NowcastPeriodineachfile", and "BiasCorrection" variables
   required for the new version. 
- Changed autoval/report/html.py to list the stations based on their location
  and observational data source.
- Changed autoval/report/field.py to plot the coastline and spatial maps 
  independently of the "csdllib" package.
- Changed autoval/report/skill.py to plot the averaged skill maps independently 
  of the "csdllib" package
- Changed the autoval/plot/waterlevel.py to plot the nowcast period in addition 
  to the forecast period.
- Changed the autoval/plot/waterlevel.py to show the corrected bias on
  time series.
- Added new .ini domain files for the Pacific domain.
- Moved tests, cfg.domains, and cfg.storm folders out of the autoval code 
  directory.
- Updated README.md to include more information for users.
- Added four tests for new users.
- Added requirements.txt file listing the required libraries.
- Removed "csdllib" dependency from setup.py as it is not functioning properly 
  and causing errors.
